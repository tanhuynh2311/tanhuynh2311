ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tan Huynh Nhat.

# Introduce
I am working as a Software Engineer.

I can develop web systems with MVC and HMVC patterns using PHP as back end, VueJS as front end and Mysql as database.
In addition, I was able to build a basic server to deploy the website.
Most of the knowledge I have accumulated comes from my own research and practical work.

I love traveling, reading, and playing with my pets.

# Hard skills
I can build systems with MVC patterns using server rendering and client rendering.

I have skills in relational database design and query optimization. In addition, I can also work with non-relational databases.

I can use Git to manage the source code and apply Git to deploy the system to the server.

I can build a server to deploy a web system.

The languages and technologies I use often include PHP, Javascript, Codeigniter, Laravel/Laravel Lumen, VueJS, Git, Mysql.
In addition, I also use other languages and technologies such as NodeJS, MongoDB, Docker.

# Soft skills
I can self-study the necessary knowledge at work and actively learn more outside knowledge when the company has new projects in the future.

I can break big tasks into small ones and get them done in the scheduled time.

I can give presentations and explain to other members about the work and results after it has been completed.

I can connect with colleagues in the same office and other departments.
