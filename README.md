ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tan Huynh Nhat
I am working as a Software Engineer.
I can develop web systems with MVC and HMVC patterns using PHP as back end, VueJS as front end and Mysql as database.
In addition, I was able to build a basic server to deploy the website.
I can connect with other colleagues in the same company.
Most of the knowledge I have accumulated comes from my own research and practical work.
I love traveling, reading, and playing with my pets.
I want to use my skills and knowledge to contribute to the company as a software engineer
